# quoteGenerator
This is a simple, beginner-friendly project, created with html,css along with some bootstrap classes, and vanilla javascript. The concept is that whenever someone clicks the button, a self-love quote is generated randomly from an array of pre-existing quotes.
So, practicing self-love along with coding makes perfect!!
